CONCLUSION:

hierarchical cluster algorithm’s in-depth intuition and approaches, such as the Agglomerative Clustering and Divisive Clustering approach.
Hierarchical Clustering is often used in the form of descriptive rather than predictive modeling.
Mostly we use Hierarchical Clustering when the application requires a hierarchy. The advantage of Hierarchical Clustering is we don’t have to pre-specify the clusters. 
However, it doesn’t work very well on vast amounts of data or huge datasets. And there are some disadvantages of the Hierarchical Clustering algorithm that it is not suitable for large datasets. And it gives the best results in some cases only.


Hierarchical Clustering is an unsupervised Learning Algorithm, and this is one of the most popular clustering technique in Machine Learning. 
Expectations of getting insights from machine learning algorithms is increasing abruptly. Initially, we were limited to predict the future by feeding historical data. 
This is easy when the expected results and the features in the historical data are available to build the supervised learning models, which can predict the future.
For example predicting the email is spam or not, using the historical email data.
