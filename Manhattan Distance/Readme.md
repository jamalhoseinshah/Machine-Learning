Calculate Manhattan Distance in R


The Manhattan distance between two vectors, A and B, is calculated as:

Σ|ai – bi|

where i is the ith element in each vector.

This distance is used to measure the dissimilarity between any two vectors and is commonly used in many different machine learning algorithms.
