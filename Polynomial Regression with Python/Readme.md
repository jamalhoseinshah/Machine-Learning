### Comparsion b/w linear Regression & Polynomial Regression

In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x.

Why Polynomial Regression?

Because it’s much much more accurate!

We are already know the salary of 5 YE is $110,000 and 6 YE is $150,000. It means the salary of 5.5 YE should be between them

It’s mostly 7.75 times more accurate than using Linear Regression!

So how to calculate the salary for our 5.5 YE candidate? We can quick calculate by using the Mean value. Because 5.5 is the average of 5 and 6, so the salary could be calculated as:

    (150,000 + 110,000) / 2 = $130,000

Note: if you don’t know what is Mean value, please read my previous post about Mean, Median, and Mode. Thanks.

But it’s not the highest accuracy rate and too manual! Let’s apply the Machine Learning for more accuracy and flexible calculation
