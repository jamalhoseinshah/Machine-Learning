### Convolutional neural network CNN

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.
A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images. Because this tutorial uses the Keras Sequential API, creating and training your model will take just a few lines of code.

Your simple CNN has achieved a test accuracy of over 70%. Not bad for a few lines of code.

CNN is a supervised type of Deep learning, most preferable used in image recognition and computer vision.


What is the main advantage of CNN?

The main advantage of CNN compared to its predecessors is that it automatically detects the important features without any human supervision. For example, given many pictures of cats and dogs it learns distinctive features for each class by itself. CNN is also computationally efficient.


What is convolutional neural network example?

Image result for convolutional neural network
When we talk about computer vision, a term convolutional neural network( abbreviated as CNN) comes in our mind because CNN is heavily used here. Examples of CNN in computer vision are face recognition, image classification etc. It is similar to the basic neural network.

Why is it called convolutional neural network?

 
To teach an algorithm how to recognise objects in images, we use a specific type of Artificial Neural Network: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Their name stems from one of the most important operations in the network: convolution. Convolutional Neural Networks are inspired by the brain.


Is CNN used only for images?
Yes. CNN can be applied on any 2D and 3D array of data.
