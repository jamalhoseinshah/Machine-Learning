### Convolutional neural network CNN

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.
A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images. Because this tutorial uses the Keras Sequential API, creating and training your model will take just a few lines of code.
Your simple CNN has achieved a test accuracy of over 70%. Not bad for a few lines of code.
