#### Project ML Facies 

This project is created by jamal hussain shah.

 In this example, I will walk you through the process of building a model for the geoscience dataset. This dataset consists of 40 variables and 2,000 observations. This tutorial has four parts:

1. Model building
2. Model evaluation metrics
3. Model evaluation discussion
4. Conclusion - Part.4b

* Part.1: Exploratory Data Analysis, 
* Part.2: Build Model & Validate, 
* Part.3: Model Evaluation-1, 
* Part.4: Model Evaluation-2. 
* Part.4b: In the final part, we will examine model performances on blind well data that we kept out of models exposure.
