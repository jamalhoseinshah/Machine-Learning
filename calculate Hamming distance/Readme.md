The Hamming distance between two vectors is simply the sum of corresponding elements that differ between the vectors.

For example, suppose we have the following two vectors:

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]

y = [1, 2, 5, 7]

The Hamming distance between the two vectors would be 2, since this is the total number of corresponding elements that have different values.

To calculate the Hamming distance between two vectors in R, we can use the following syntax:

sum(x != y)
