The Minkowski distance between two vectors, A and B, is calculated as:

(Σ|ai – bi|p)1/p

where i is the ith element in each vector and p is an integer.

This distance is used to measure the dissimilarity between any two vectors and is commonly used in many different machine learning algorithms.

To calculate the Minkowski distance between vectors in R, we can use the built-in dist() function with the following syntax:

dist(x, method=”minkowski”, p)

where:

    x: A numeric matrix or data frame.
    p: The power to use in the Minkowski distance calculation.

Note that setting p = 1 is equivalent to calculating the Manhattan distance and setting p = 2 is equivalent to calculating the Euclidean distance.
