In this document, we are going to explore the K-means Clustering algorithm in R. We will be working with the iris dataset.

K-means Clustering is used with unlabeled data, but in this case, we have a labeled dataset so we have to use the iris data without the Species column. In this way, algorithm will cluster the data and we will be able to compare the predicted results with the original results, getting the accuracy of the model.
