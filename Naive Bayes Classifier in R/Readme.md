# Naive Bayes Classifier in R Programming

Naive Bayes is a Supervised Non-linear classification algorithm in R Programming. Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Baye’s theorem with strong(Naive) independence assumptions between the features or variables. The Naive Bayes algorithm is called “Naive” because it makes the assumption that the occurrence of a certain feature is independent of the occurrence of other features.


Theory

Naive Bayes algorithm is based on Bayes theorem. Bayes theorem gives the conditional probability of an event A given another event B has occurred.
